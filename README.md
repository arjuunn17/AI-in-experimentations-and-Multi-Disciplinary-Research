Abstract

This report synthesises findings from ten diverse multidisciplinary research areas, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and large language model (LLM) evaluation to structural engineering and archaeological science. The central theme explores how the integration of disparate fields—such as Electrical and Civil Engineering or Psychology and Neuroscience—accelerates problem-solving in complex, real-world scenarios. A primary focus is placed on the development of automated systems like the AI Urban Scientist, which utilizes a knowledge-driven multi-agent framework to emulate the scientific research lifecycle. Furthermore, the report examines the R-Bench, a graduate-level benchmark designed to measure the reasoning limits of LLMs across 108 subjects. In the field of information fusion, strategies for harmonising "Hard" sensor data with "Soft" human reports are detailed to support military and intelligence operations. Engineering applications include the Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) of axial turbines using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to achieve high efficiency. Finally, the report investigates the social and organizational aspects of Medical Informatics, the science of Expertise, and the use of biomolecular techniques in Archaeology. These studies collectively demonstrate that cross-disciplinary methodologies provide the necessary rigor and innovation to address challenges that single-domain approaches cannot resolve.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Multidisciplinary research has become the cornerstone of modern scientific discovery, enabling the synthesis of existing knowledge to solve increasingly complex problems. This report outlines the application of AI and formal modeling across several sectors, highlighting the shift from manual, fragmented workflows toward automated scientific discovery.
The first major area is Artificial Intelligence in Marketing, where learning is defined as a process that improves a program's knowledge through environmental observations. These processes are mathematically modeled as input-output pairs to predict outcomes for new data, utilizing expert systems that emulate human decision-making via inference cycles and knowledge bases.
Simultaneously, the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates more rigorous evaluation. Existing benchmarks have become saturated, leading to the development of R-Bench, a comprehensive system that assesses complex reasoning capabilities in both language and multimodal contexts across 108 graduate-level subjects.
In the realm of Urban Science, the AI Urban Scientist framework introduces a knowledge-driven approach to automate research. This system manages the lifecycle of generating hypotheses, integrating heterogeneous data, and drafting manuscripts. Similarly, the SmartEN project integrates Electrical and Civil Engineering to manage structural systems and heritage infrastructure proactively.
The report also introduces Information Fusion, focusing on the harmonization of "Hard" data (e.g., RF sensors) and "Soft" data (e.g., digitized human text) to improve situational awareness in counter-insurgency operations. Engineering optimization is represented through the study of axial turbines, where Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) reduces lead times and costs while maximizing performance.
Finally, we explore Medical Informatics, emphasizing the need to incorporate Information Systems (IS) theory to understand the social and organizational assimilation of healthcare technology. This is complemented by a look into the Science of Expertise, which uses psychological and neuroscientific lenses to understand expert behavior, and an Archaeological study that employs biomolecular analysis to identify the specialized function of prehistoric slate tools.

Chapter 2: Literature Review

2.1. Expert Systems and AI Learning Models

Literature on AI in marketing identifies learning as a fundamental building block, categorized into knowledge-based and feedback-based learning. Expert systems are defined by their internal components: a knowledge base, working memory, and an inference engine. Reasoning strategies involve Forward Chaining, a data-driven linear search, and Backward Chaining, which works from a goal back to its premises.

2.2. Benchmarking Reasoning in LLMs

The literature on foundation models suggests that traditional assessments often measure "System-I" (fast, intuitive thinking) rather than "System-II" (slow, deliberate reasoning). R-Bench fills this gap by introducing four critical properties: comprehensiveness, difficulty, multimodality, and multilingualism. Research indicates that models like GPT-4o and o1 show a significant performance drop when transitioning from text-only to multimodal reasoning.

2.3. CAMP Theory in Urban Science

The AI Urban Scientist leverages the CAMP theory for hypothesis generation. Under this framework, a hypothesis is decomposed into Context (C), Independent/Dependent Variables (A & B), Mechanism (M), and Pattern (P). Prior literature (over 15,000 papers) provides the seed ideas for this system to perform scientific transformations such as context exchange and mechanism substitution.

2.4. Structural Management and Signal Processing

The SmartEN Project literature highlights the technical disconnect between engineering fields. It focuses on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). Key metrics like the Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) are identified as vital statistical indicators for correlating measured vibration modes with analytical models to detect deterioration.

2.5. Information Fusion Architectures

Research at the University at Buffalo reviews the JDL Fusion Process, specifically for counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The literature advocates for a Technology-Risk-Mitigation approach, separating data modalities (Hard/Soft) initially to avoid the high risk associated with poorly understood human data.

2.6. Turbine Design and Optimization

Literature on Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) emphasizes the need for high power density at lower costs. The design process is categorized into preliminary and detail design, utilizing CFD tools like NUMECA and FEA tools like ANSYS.

2.7. Medical Informatics and Information Systems

The sources contrast Medical Informatics (MI), which focuses on the "IT artifact" and clinical outcomes, with Information Systems (IS), which focuses on organizational behavior. The integration of Technology-Use Mediation (TUM) and Genre Theory is identified as a way to understand how medical technologies are assimilated into work practices.

2.8. The Science of Expertise

This field distinguishes between Performance-based expertise (P-expertise) and Reputation-based expertise (R-expertise). Literature identifies bounded rationality—the cognitive limitation of memory and learning rates—as a key constraint that experts overcome through "chunking" and massive knowledge acquisition.

2.9. Prehistoric Technology and Residue Analysis

Archaeological literature traditionally relied on morphology to determine tool function. Recent studies on ground slate tools from Scandinavia demonstrate that use-wear and organic residue analysis (lipid extraction, stable isotopes) can identify specific prehistoric activities like seal butchery.

Chapter 3: Application - Type and Working

3.1. Expert Systems in Financial Advice

These systems are applied in financial advisory programs to assist bankers with investment and foreign exchange decisions. Working Mechanism: The system takes in queries, matches them against the knowledge base using the inference engine, and resolves conflicts when multiple rules apply. It provides an explanation module so the user can understand the reasoning process.

3.2. R-Bench for Model Calibration

Type: Evaluation Framework. Working: The system uses a six-step pipeline to screen, digitize, and filter questions. It utilizes o1 model-based filtering to identify questions requiring more than 2,000 reasoning tokens. Results are converted into a single-choice format with six options, including "All other answers are incorrect," to allow for automated, unbiased evaluation.

3.3. Multi-Agent AI Urban Scientist

Type: Collaborative Automation Platform. Working: The platform coordinates five specialized agents: Ideation, Search, Analysis, Writing, and Critic. The Ideation Agent uses CAMP components to mutate hypotheses. The Data Agent extracts information from scientific "Data Availability" sections to create standardized data cards.

3.4. Structural Monitoring via SmartEN

Type: Smart Proactive Management. Working: The application involves 3D scanning of steel rebars with 0.1mm accuracy to compare them against intact models. Modal Analysis is performed by accelerating vibrations to find natural frequencies; the MAC matrix then measures the correlation between experimental and analytical mode-shapes to identify damage.

3.5. Military Information Fusion

Type: Distributed Data Fusion. Working: The framework uses Directed Attributed Relationship Graphs (DARGs) to represent situational hypotheses. Graph matching algorithms find "situations of interest" by comparing template graphs to accumulated data. It also employs Conceptual Spaces—geometric representations of human concepts—to bridge the gap between linguistic (soft) and feature-based (hard) data.

3.6. Axial Turbine Design Optimization

Type: Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO). Working: Designers use a two-layered Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict performance metrics like efficiency and mass flow rate based on geometric parameters. This avoids the need for repetitive CFD simulations. Final designs are verified in ANSYS to ensure mechanical integrity at 115% of design speed.

3.7. Healthcare IT Assimilation

Type: Technology-Use Mediation (TUM). Working: Large hospitals dedicate clinical staff as mediators to configure electronic medical records (EMRs) to fit local work patterns. Genre Theory is used to analyze how changing the communication medium (e.g., from paper to digital orders) alters social relations and hierarchies between doctors and nurses.

3.8. Computational Modeling of Expertise

Type: CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and Retrieval Structures). Working: This AI model simulates human cognitive mechanisms like short-term memory capacity and parallel feature identification. It predicts how experts recall random vs. meaningful domain-specific material, helping to design better training methods for coaches and schools.

3.9. Archaeological Residue Analysis

Type: Multi-Disciplinary Microscopy. Working: Researchers use 3D-printed replicas of prehistoric slate knives to measure residue accumulation patterns during experiments. These are matched to optical microscopy and GC-MS stable isotope data (δ13C) from actual artefacts to identify specific traces of seal hair and marine fats.

3.10. Patient Grouping via Factor Analysis

Type: Logistic Management Tool. Working: The system uses clustering and factor analysis on variables like "specialist visit frequency" and "departmental shifts". It identifies two latent facets: "complexity due to shifts" and "complexity in time span". Machine learning (C4.5) then generates predictive rules to assign new patients to the correct care cluster based on their initial diagnosis.

Conclusion and Future Work

The multidisciplinary research presented in the sources highlights the convergence of AI, engineering, and social science to manage modern complexities. The transition from expert systems to multi-agent LLM scientists indicates a trend toward autonomous scientific discovery. Future work in LLMs must address the "modality gap" to improve reasoning in visual contexts. In urban science, the development of quantitative benchmarks for hypothesis quality is essential for building confidence in automated agents. Engineering projects like SmartEN suggest that energy harvesting for sensor networks will be a critical next step for sustainable infrastructure. Finally, the fusion of biomolecular archaeology and computational cognitive modeling offers new pathways to understanding both human history and the mechanisms of superior human performance.
